Software package for the [paper](https://engineering.lehigh.edu/sites/engineering.lehigh.edu/files/_DEPARTMENTS/ise/pdf/tech-papers/21/21T_007.pdf) "The max k-cut problem on classical and quantum solvers" by Ramin Fakhimi, Hamidreza Validi, Illya V. Hicks, Tamas Terlaky, and Luis F. Zuluaga.

The max k-cut problem is easy to be explained, but hard to be solved: How to color the nodes of a graph with at most $k$ colors such that the number of edges with distinct colored endpoints is maximized?
