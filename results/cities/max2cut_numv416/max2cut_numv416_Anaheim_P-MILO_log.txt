Deterministic concurrent LP optimizer: primal simplex, dual simplex, and barrier
Showing barrier log only...

Root barrier log...


Barrier performed 0 iterations in 301.28 seconds (196.71 work units)
Barrier solve interrupted - model solved by another algorithm

Concurrent spin time: 86.29s (can be avoided by choosing Method=3)

Solved with dual simplex

Root relaxation: objective 1.522289e+06, 0 iterations, 159.36 seconds (28.64 work units)
